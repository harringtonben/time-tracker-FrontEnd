## Time Tracker App Front End

This is the front end portion of the time tracker app that I built as a front end capstone for the support team managers at Emma to be able to track shift data for the team members and get better metrics and reporting on that data.

![Demo](https://github.com/harringtonben/time-tracker-frontend/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-19%20at%2011.02.17%20AM.png?raw=true)

#### Built With: 

- AngularJS
- Grunt
- Javascript
- Materialize CSS
- SASS


#### How to run (Node must be installed on your machine):

```git clone (git@github.com:harringtonben/time-tracker-frontend.git)
cd (time-tracker-frontend)
cd into lib folder
npm init
npm install
type grunt in terminal window (still in lib folder)
hs 
```

#####  This will show in your browser at: http://localhost:8080
#####  You will also need to have the [backend portion](https://github.com/harringtonben/time-tracker-API) of this project cloned and running for the front end to work correctly.
